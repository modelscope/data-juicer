# This tool is used to convert dataset in Data-Juicer format to a
# target dataset in ModelScope-Swift Messages-like format.
#
# Data-Juicer format (query-response format):
# [
#   {
#     "images": ["coco/train2017/000000033471.jpg"],
#     "query": "Is the bus driving down the street or pulled off to the side?",
#     "response": "The bus is driving down the street, which is crowded with people and other vehicles."  # noqa: E501
#     "history": [
#       [
#         "<image>\nWhat are the colors of the bus in the image?",
#         "The bus in the image is white and red."
#       ],
#       [
#         "What feature can be seen on the back of the bus?",
#         "The back of the bus features an advertisement."
#       ],
#     ]
#   },
#   ...
# ]
#
# Corresponding ModelScope-Swift Messages format:
#   - usually in json format
# [
#   {
#     "images": ["coco/train2017/000000033471.jpg"],
#     "messages": [
#       {
#         "role": "human",
#         "content": "<image>\nWhat are the colors of the bus in the image?"
#       },
#       {
#         "role": "gpt",
#         "content": "The bus in the image is white and red."
#       },
#       {
#         "role": "human",
#         "content": "What feature can be seen on the back of the bus?"
#       },
#       {
#         "role": "gpt",
#         "content": "The back of the bus features an advertisement."
#       },
#       {
#         "role": "human",
#         "content": "Is the bus driving down the street or pulled off to the side?"  # noqa: E501
#       },
#       {
#         "role": "gpt",
#         "content": "The bus is driving down the street, which is crowded with people and other vehicles."  # noqa: E501
#       }
#     ]
#   },
#   ...
# ]
#
# Reference:
# https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift/blob/main/docs/source_en/Customization/Custom-dataset.md
#
# This format is nearly the same as the LLaMA-Factory ShareGPT format, so we
# reuse the code in that conversion tools.
