# This tool is used for evaluating a quality classifier on your own datasets
# based on PySpark.
#
# We provide several trained models for you. Please refer to the comments at
# the beginning of predict tool for more details.
#
# This tool needs several arguments:
#   - positive_datasets: the paths to the positive datasets. It could be a
#       string for a single dataset, e.g. 'pos.parquet', or a list of strings
#       for several datasets, e.g. '["pos1.parquet", "pos2.parquet"]'.
#   - negative_datasets: the paths to the negative datasets. It could be a
#       string for a single dataset, e.g. 'neg.parquet', or a list of strings
#       for several datasets, e.g. '["neg1.parquet", "neg2.parquet"]'.
#   - model: quality classifier name to apply. It's "gpt3" in default. You can
#       use one of ["gpt3", "chinese", "code"] we provided, or you can set it
#       to the path to your own model trained using the train.py tool.
#   - tokenizer: what tokenizer to use to tokenize texts. It's None in default,
#       which means using the standard Tokenizer of PySpark. You can use one of
#       ["zh.sp.model", "code.sp.model"] we provided, or you can set it to the
#       path to your own sentencepiece model.
#   - text_key: the field key name to hold texts to be classified. It's "text"
#       in default.
