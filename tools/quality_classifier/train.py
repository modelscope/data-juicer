# This tool is used for training a quality classifier for your own datasets
# based on PySpark.
#
# After training, this tool will generate a classifier model in a specific
# directory. You can use it to evaluate or predict on other datasets using eval
# and predict tools.
#
# This tool needs several arguments:
#   - positive_datasets: the paths to the positive datasets. It could be a
#       string for a single dataset, e.g. 'pos.parquet', or a list of strings
#       for several datasets, e.g. '["pos1.parquet", "pos2.parquet"]'.
#   - negative_datasets: the paths to the negative datasets. It could be a
#       string for a single dataset, e.g. 'neg.parquet', or a list of strings
#       for several datasets, e.g. '["neg1.parquet", "neg2.parquet"]'.
#   - output_model_path: the path to store the trained quality classifier. It's
#       "my_quality_model" in default.
#   - num_training_samples: number of samples used to train the model. It's 0
#       in default, which means using all samples in datasets to train.
#   - train_test_split_ratio: ratio to split train and test set. It's 0.8 in
#       default.
#   - tokenizer: what tokenizer to use to tokenize texts. It's None in default,
#       which means using the standard Tokenizer of PySpark. You can use one of
#       ["zh.sp.model", "code.sp.model"] we provided, or you can set it to the
#       path to your own sentencepiece model.
#   - evaluation: whether to evaluate the model after training using test set.
#       It's True in default.
#   - text_key: the field key name to hold texts to be classified. It's "text"
#       in default.
