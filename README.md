  <b>Multimodal | Cloud-Native | AI-Ready | Large-Scale </b>
</p>

Data-Juicer (DJ) transforms raw data chaos into AI-ready intelligence. It treats data processing as *composable infrastructure*—providing modular building blocks to clean, synthesize, and analyze data across the entire AI lifecycle, unlocking latent value in every byte.

Whether you're deduplicating web-scale pre-training corpora, curating agent interaction traces, or preparing domain-specific RAG indices, DJ scales seamlessly from your laptop to thousand-node clusters—no glue code required.

> **Alibaba Cloud PAI** has deeply integrated Data-Juicer into its data processing products.  See **[Quickly submit a DataJuicer job](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/pai/user-guide/quickly-submit-a-datajuicer-task)**.

**Zero-install exploration**:
- [JupyterLab Playground with Tutorials](http://8.138.149.181/)
- [Ask DJ Copilot](https://datajuicer.github.io/data-juicer/en/main/docs_index.html)

**Install & run**:
```bash
uv pip install py-data-juicer
dj-process --config demos/process_simple/process.yaml
```

**Or compose in Python**:
```python
from data_juicer.core.data import NestedDataset
from data_juicer.ops.filter import TextLengthFilter
from data_juicer.ops.mapper import WhitespaceNormalizationMapper

ds = NestedDataset.from_dict({
    "text": ["Short", "This passes the filter.", "Text   with   spaces"]
})
res_ds = ds.process([
    TextLengthFilter(min_len=10),
    WhitespaceNormalizationMapper()
])

for s in res_ds:
    print(s)
```

## 📰 News

- 🎉 [2026-08-25] We release [Juicer](docs/Juicer.md), a locally deployable data-refinement model that follows natural-language instructions for text cleaning, filtering, and semantic labeling. Explore the [model](https://huggingface.co/datajuicer/Juicer-35B-A3B) and try recipes in the [Juicer Playground](https://github.com/datajuicer/data-juicer-hub/tree/main/juicer_playground).

<details open>
<summary>[2026-08-07] Release v1.5.5: <b>External OP Plugins; HDFS I/O & Ray Data Optimizations; Elastic Multi-node Sharding</b></summary>

* 🧩 *External OP Plugins* — Third-party operators can now be shipped as standalone pip packages and auto-registered via Python entry points.
* 🗄️ *HDFS I/O* — Added `hdfs://` support for dataset loading and exporting, aligned with the existing S3 path.
* ⚡ *Ray Data Optimizations* — Removed eager actions that forced premature execution, migrated to the public `TaskPoolStrategy`/`ActorPoolStrategy` APIs, parallelized partitioned execution, preserved elastic actor pool concurrency, and kept partition checkpoints valid across block-layout changes.
* 🌐 *Elastic Multi-node Sharding* — New runnable reference workflow under `demos/elastic_sharding/` that shards large JSONL datasets across nodes via node-local Ray executors, with retries and ordered merge.
* 📊 *Distributed RayAnalyzer* — New `RayAnalyzer` computes and aggregates dataset stats with Ray native operators, avoiding pandas materialization.
* 🧮 *Memory Optimizations* — Streamed n-gram counting in repetition filters and block-wise MinHash permutations cut peak memory (768 → 272 MiB RSS) without changing results.
* 🔧 *Robustness & Dependency Fixes* — Fixed `text_chunk_mapper` delimiter leakage, `calibrate_response_mapper` `output_pattern` handling, and null captions in `image_diffusion_mapper`; added membership operators to `general_field_filter`; relaxed `numpy`/`fsspec`/`pandas` bounds for Python 3.13+ and pyarrow>=17.

<details open>
<summary>[2026-07-17] Release v1.5.4: <b>HumanVBench Video OPs; Batch-local Stage Fusion; Robustness Fixes</b></summary>

* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 *New OPs* — Added 9 human-centric video understanding operators (human track extraction, active-speaker detection, audio ASR, speech emotion & age/gender detection, face demographic & attribute/emotion captioning, face-ratio filtering) for building HumanVBench (CVPR'26)-style pipelines.
* ⚡ *Batch-local Stage Fusion* — New `FusedSequentialBatchOp` fuses consecutive OPs within a batch to cut inter-op overhead and speed up sequential processing.
* 🔧 *Robustness & Install Fixes* — Fixed Ray deduplicator shared-state handling, resolved a relative-path issue in the Ray checkpoint writer, made `clean_html_mapper` robust to null text values, handled boolean stat columns in `ColumnWiseAnalysis`, and unblocked ARM64 (aarch64) installation via precise `decord`/`torchcodec` platform markers.
* 🧪 *Test Coverage & Cleanup* — Expanded tests for utility functions and model handling, plus assorted code cleanup.

* 🤖 *Agent Data Quality Toolkit* — Shipped interaction-quality OPs & recipe, a bad-case HTML report, and more robust JSONL / HuggingFace meta loading.
* 📦 *Leaner & Faster Install* — Slimmed the default dependency set (Ray, audio, spaCy, av, etc. moved to on-demand extras) to speed up installation.
* 🐳 *Stability & Robustness Fixes* — Library-safe error handling (raise over `exit(1)`), Ray init/temp-dir fixes, valid API params (drop invalid `max_new_tokens`), PyArrow 20+ batch JSON reading, local-path aesthetics model support, and more performance/bug fixes.
