# Operator Schemas

Operators are a collection of basic processes that assist in data modification, cleaning, filtering, deduplication, etc. We support a wide range of data sources and file formats, and allow for flexible extension to custom datasets.


## Overview

The operators in Data-Juicer are categorized into 5 types.

| Type                              | Number | Description                                     |
|-----------------------------------|:------:|-------------------------------------------------|
| [ Formatter ]( #formatter )       |   7    | Discovers, loads, and canonicalizes source data |
| [ Mapper ]( #mapper )             |   23   | Edits and transforms samples                    |
| [ Filter ]( #filter )             |   24   | Filters out low-quality samples                 |
| [ Deduplicator ]( #deduplicator ) |   4    | Detects and removes duplicate samples           |
| [ Selector ]( #selector )         |   2    | Selects top samples based on ranking            |


All the specific operators are listed below, each featured with several capability tags.
