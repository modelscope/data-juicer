# Processing Data

This guide covers running data processing pipelines with Data-Juicer—both CLI and Python API.

> If you haven't run your first pipeline yet, start with the [Quick Start](tutorial/QuickStart.md).
> For the full parameter list, see [Global Configuration Reference](GlobalConfig.md).

## CLI

### Basic Usage

```bash
dj-process --config my-recipe.yaml
```

Data-Juicer reads the recipe, executes operators in the listed order by default, and writes results to `export_path`.

### Command-Line Overrides

Override any recipe parameter without modifying the YAML:

```bash
dj-process --config recipe.yaml --np 8 --export_path ./out/result.parquet
dj-process --config recipe.yaml --language_id_score_filter.lang=en
```

### Auto-Install Operator Dependencies

```bash
dj-install --config my-recipe.yaml
```

The tool scans source files for the operators in the recipe and preinstalls the dependencies it identifies. See [Installation](tutorial/Installation.md) for the scan scope and environment preparation.

## Python API

The Python API provides finer control than YAML recipes—ideal for training scripts, notebooks, or automated pipelines.

### Option 1: Load a Recipe

```python
from data_juicer.config import init_configs
from data_juicer.core import DefaultExecutor

cfg = init_configs(args=['--config', 'my-recipe.yaml'])
executor = DefaultExecutor(cfg)
dataset = executor.run()
```

If you already hold a dataset object in memory (e.g. assembled or sampled upstream), you can skip the recipe's data source and reuse only its operator pipeline:

```python
dataset = executor.run(dataset=my_dataset, skip_export=True)
```

### Option 2: Instantiate Operators from Config

No YAML needed—assemble an operator chain in Python:

```python
from data_juicer.ops import load_ops
from data_juicer.core import NestedDataset

# Load ops from dict config (same format as YAML process list)
ops = load_ops([
    {'language_id_score_filter': {'lang': 'en', 'min_score': 0.8}},
    {'text_length_filter': {'min_len': 10, 'max_len': 50000}},
    {'document_minhash_deduplicator': {'tokenization': 'space', 'window_size': 5}},
])

dataset = NestedDataset(NestedDataset.from_json('my-data.jsonl'))
dataset = dataset.process(ops)
```

### Option 3: Fine-Grained Single-Operator Control

When you need conditional logic, loops, or intermediate inspection:

```python
from data_juicer.ops.filter import LanguageIDScoreFilter, TextLengthFilter
from data_juicer.ops.deduplicator import DocumentMinhashDeduplicator
from data_juicer.core import NestedDataset

dataset = NestedDataset(NestedDataset.from_json('my-data.jsonl'))

# Step 1: Language filter
lang_filter = LanguageIDScoreFilter(lang='en', min_score=0.8)
dataset = lang_filter.run(dataset=dataset)
print(f"After language filter: {len(dataset)} samples")

# Step 2: Conditional dedup — only when dataset is large
if len(dataset) > 10000:
    dedup = DocumentMinhashDeduplicator(tokenization='space', window_size=5)
    dataset = dedup.run(dataset=dataset)
    print(f"After dedup: {len(dataset)} samples")

# Step 3: Length filter
length_filter = TextLengthFilter(min_len=10, max_len=50000)
dataset = length_filter.run(dataset=dataset)
```

### Option 4: Dynamic Operator Composition

Choose operators programmatically based on data characteristics—useful for automated pipelines:

```python
from data_juicer.ops import load_ops
from data_juicer.core import NestedDataset

dataset = NestedDataset(NestedDataset.from_json('input.jsonl'))

# Inspect data to decide processing strategy
sample = dataset[0]
ops_config = []

# Add language filter if text field exists
if 'text' in sample:
    ops_config.append({'language_id_score_filter': {'lang': 'en', 'min_score': 0.5}})

# Add image filter if images present
if 'images' in sample and sample['images']:
    ops_config.append({'image_shape_filter': {'min_width': 256, 'min_height': 256}})

# Common cleaning
ops_config.append({'clean_html_mapper': {}})
ops_config.append({'text_length_filter': {'min_len': 10}})

ops = load_ops(ops_config)
dataset = dataset.process(ops)
```

## API Models

Use an API operator such as `extract_keyword_mapper` to process text with a hosted model. Set `api_model` to the model name supplied by your service and configure the connection in `model_params`.

### OpenAI-Compatible Services

Install the API dependencies in your activated environment:

```bash
uv pip install "py-data-juicer[ai_services]"
```

Set the service URL and API key in your shell:

```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

To use another OpenAI-compatible service, replace the URL and key with that service's values. Save this recipe as `extract.yaml` and set `dataset_path` to a JSONL file with a `text` field:

```yaml
dataset_path: ./input.jsonl
export_path: ./outputs/extracted.jsonl
keep_stats_in_res_ds: true

process:
  - extract_keyword_mapper:
      api_model: gpt-4o-mini
      model_params:
        api_backend: openai_compatible
      sampling_params:
        temperature: 0
```

Run `dj-process --config extract.yaml`. The operator saves the extracted keywords under `__dj__meta__.keyword`; `keep_stats_in_res_ds: true` retains that metadata in the output.

`openai_compatible` is the default backend. You can also supply `base_url` and `api_key` in `model_params`; these values take precedence over the corresponding environment variables.

### LiteLLM

To route requests through LiteLLM, set `model_params.api_backend: litellm` and use a provider-qualified model name. For example, replace the operator entry in the recipe above with:

```yaml
process:
  - extract_keyword_mapper:
      api_model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
      model_params:
        api_backend: litellm
      sampling_params:
        temperature: 0
```

Configure credentials for the selected provider. The OpenAI example uses `OPENAI_API_KEY`; other providers use their own LiteLLM authentication settings. You can supply `api_key` and `base_url` in `model_params` when the provider requires them.

Choose an operator that supports the task you need. The API backend supports chat, embedding, and Responses endpoints; operators that expose `api_endpoint` can select the corresponding endpoint. Use `sampling_params` for request options such as temperature and `model_params` for the backend, service URL, and credentials.

## Operator Execution Order

By default, operators run **top-to-bottom sequentially**. Order matters:

1. **Cheap filters first**: Text length, language ID—reduce sample count early
2. **Dedup in the middle**: Requires global state; run after initial filtering
3. **Expensive operators last**: GPU inference only sees the filtered subset

```yaml
process:
  # Cheap
  - text_length_filter: { min_len: 10, max_len: 50000 }
  - language_id_score_filter: { lang: en, min_score: 0.5 }
  # Dedup
  - document_minhash_deduplicator: { tokenization: space, window_size: 5 }
  # Expensive
  - clean_html_mapper: {}
  - perplexity_filter: { lang: en, max_ppl: 1500 }
```

## Performance Tuning

### Op Fusion

Fuses compatible operators to reduce repeated processing. Both default and Ray execution paths support fusion. Throughput gains depend on the recipe and data; measure them for your workload:

```yaml
op_fusion: true
fusion_strategy: probe   # probe: group and sort by measured speed; greedy: order by fusion group
```

Fusion groups compatible operators and may change their order in the recipe. With `probe`, the `default` executor and standard Analyzer use the first 1,000 rows of the current dataset by default, or all rows of a smaller dataset. Each operator runs the probe on copies of this batch, with one copy per runtime process. Ray executors arrange operators by fusion group.

### GPU Mapper Fusion

Fuses consecutive GPU Mappers into one GPU pass:

```yaml
op_fusion: true
mapper_fusion: true
adaptive_batch_size: true
```

The `default` executor uses `adaptive_batch_size` to probe and adjust batch sizes for batched operators.

### Sampling Dry Run

For a source with at least 1,000 rows, validate a recipe on 1,000 samples with the default executor by replacing its `dataset_path` with a structured `dataset` configuration. Keep its `process` list:

```yaml
dataset:
  max_sample_num: 1000
  configs:
    - type: local
      path: path/to/your/dataset.jsonl
```

Replace the path with your dataset. `max_sample_num` sets the sample count; for a small trial, choose a count no larger than the source. Larger budgets are filled by repeating samples.

Sampling runs after data loading. To also reduce input reads, prepare a small sample file and use it as the input. Remove `max_sample_num` to process the full dataset.

## Checkpointing & Resumption

```yaml
use_checkpoint: true
```

The default executor locates checkpoints by `job_id` and the working-directory base. Specify a fixed ID on the first run. To resume after interruption, run the same command with the same input, recipe, and working-directory configuration:

```bash
dj-process --config your-recipe.yaml --use_checkpoint true --job_id recipe-checkpoint
```

Checkpoints live in the resolved `<cfg.work_dir>/ckpt`, where `work_dir` includes `job_id`. `use_checkpoint` disables data caching and is mutually exclusive with `op_fusion`.

For `ray_partitioned`, finer strategies are available; resume with `--resume <job_id>`. See [Global Config](GlobalConfig.md).

## Tracing & Debugging

```yaml
open_tracer: true
trace_num: 10
```

Writes before/after comparisons per operator. See [Tracing](Tracing.md).
