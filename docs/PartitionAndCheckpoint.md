# Partitioned Processing with Checkpointing

This document describes DataJuicer's fault-tolerant processing system with partitioning, checkpointing, and event logging.

## Overview

The `ray_partitioned` executor splits datasets into partitions and processes them with configurable checkpointing. Failed jobs can resume from the last checkpoint.

**Checkpointing strategies:**
- `every_n_ops` - checkpoint every N operations (default, balanced)
- `every_op` - checkpoint after every operation (max protection, impacts performance)
- `manual` - checkpoint only after specified operations (best for known expensive ops)
- `disabled` - no checkpointing (best performance)

## Configuration

### Partition Modes

**Auto mode** (recommended) - analyzes data and resources to determine optimal partitioning:

```yaml
executor_type: ray_partitioned

partition:
  mode: "auto"
  max_concurrent_partitions: "auto"  # Resource-aware driver concurrency
  max_gpu_workers_per_device: 5       # Conservative model-replica cap per GPU
  max_concurrent_gpu_probes: "auto"   # Probe one target at a time; set an integer to opt into parallel probes
  gpu_preflight_enabled: true          # false skips preflight and uses explicit resources/actor counts
  gpu_probe_timeout_seconds: null     # Optional per-probe timeout; null disables termination
  gpu_probe_warmup_batches: 1         # Warmup batches before steady-state timing
  gpu_probe_steady_batches: 3         # Batches used for steady-state throughput
  gpu_probe_sample_offset: 0          # Leading rows skipped when sampling for preflight
  gpu_probe_sample_shuffle: false     # true randomizes block order before sampling
  gpu_probe_sample_seed: 42           # Seed for the shuffled sample; null re-samples, and never reuses the report
  execution_group_size: "auto"       # Logical partitions sharing one GPU actor lifecycle
  max_initialization_overhead_ratio: 0.1  # Allowed model-init share per execution group
  target_size_mb: 256    # Target partition size (128, 256, 512, or 1024)
  size: 5000             # Fallback if auto-analysis fails
  max_size_mb: 256       # Fallback max size
```

**Manual mode** - specify exact partition count:

```yaml
partition:
  mode: "manual"
  num_of_partitions: 8
  max_concurrent_partitions: "auto"
```

Partitions are cut at exact row boundaries, so every partition holds the same
row count give or take one row. This is deliberately not Ray's
`Dataset.split(n)`, which distributes whole blocks: a dataset with fewer blocks
than `num_of_partitions` would otherwise produce empty trailing partitions (ten
rows in one block split four ways gives `[10, 0, 0, 0]`), and unevenly sized
blocks would skew partitions even when there are enough of them. Empty
partitions are not free -- each one still builds an operator graph, consumes an
actor lifecycle and writes a checkpoint -- and skew breaks the uniform
partition-size assumption behind execution-group sizing. A partition count
larger than the row count therefore fails the job before any actor starts,
rather than being lowered silently: the count is what a resume is validated
against, so it must be the one that was asked for.

Logical partitions and GPU execution concurrency are independent. Logical
partitions define checkpoint/recovery granularity and the per-partition data
bound. Preflight throughput and cluster resources determine GPU actor counts.
An execution group sends several logical partitions through one Ray actor-pool
lifecycle while still writing a separate checkpoint for every logical
partition. `execution_group_size: "auto"` uses measured initialization time,
throughput, data volume, and `max_initialization_overhead_ratio`; a positive
integer overrides it. Resume safely falls back to serial per-partition
execution because partitions may be at different checkpoint boundaries.

The automatic actor planner starts with one actor per profiled GPU stage and
adds actors to the current pipeline bottleneck. Every addition must fit the
cluster CPU budget, Ray GPU scheduling fractions, measured per-device GPU
memory, the per-device actor cap, and useful-batch limits. If the cluster
cannot host the one-actor-per-stage minimum, execution fails before the formal
job instead of increasing partitions or oversubscribing GPU memory.

#### GPU memory preflight

For a fixed-resource control run, set `gpu_preflight_enabled: false`. The
executor will not sample input rows, create disposable probe actors, or write
`gpu_probe_results.json`. Configure CUDA `num_gpus`, `memory`, and fixed
`num_proc` values explicitly, and normally disable `auto_op_parallelism` too.

In `ray_partitioned` mode (including manual partitioning), ordinary single-GPU
CUDA Mapper/Filter operators are profiled before the formal experiment. An op
without `memory`/`num_gpus` also receives resource estimates. Explicit values
still win, but throughput is measured for automatic `num_proc` planning:

1. The executor takes a fixed prefix of the input. Its size is the largest
   `batch_size` among operators that still need probing. A dataset ordered by
   length, resolution or source makes that prefix unrepresentative and biases
   both measured memory and throughput. `gpu_probe_sample_shuffle: true`
   randomizes block order first, so the sample comes from a random block instead
   of the first one; only block references are reordered, keeping the preflight
   cost proportional to the sample rather than to the dataset. Alternatively,
   `gpu_probe_sample_offset` skips a known-unrepresentative prefix. The two are
   alternatives rather than a combination: a successful shuffle has already left
   the head, so the offset is reported as ignored. Changing either option
   invalidates `gpu_probe_results.json`, because measurements from a different
   part of the dataset are not comparable. A shuffle without
   `gpu_probe_sample_seed` samples different rows on every run, so its report is
   written for observability but never reused as a cache.
2. Operators may declare `input_columns` and `output_columns`, including
   nested paths such as `__dj__meta__.quality_score`. The executor builds a
   conservative data-dependency graph from these contracts.
3. Targets proven independent, with only compatible CPU Mapper/Filter
   ancestors, can run concurrently. Each disposable Ray worker receives the
   lightweight source rows, replays its required CPU ancestors locally, and
   reserves one full GPU for the target. Large intermediate NumPy values are
   therefore not round-tripped through the driver. The default
   `max_concurrent_gpu_probes: "auto"` probes one target at a time: concurrent
   probes initialize several models at once, and neither checkpoint storage nor
   host-memory bandwidth is a Ray resource, so nothing automatic can tell whether
   the node can sustain them. Set a positive integer to opt into parallel probing
   when checkpoints are local or the I/O headroom is known; the value is still
   bounded by the dependency-safe GPU and CPU slots.
   Workers log dependency replay and measured-target timing. The driver logs
   each completion immediately and emits a progress heartbeat every 30 seconds.
   `gpu_probe_timeout_seconds` can fail a stalled target with its operator name;
   the default `null` keeps timeout termination disabled.
4. Missing contracts, GPU-to-GPU dependencies, runtime-environment conflicts,
   and dataset-level operations conservatively fall back to the original
   ordered recipe replay. If an earlier filter leaves too few rows, surviving
   rows are cycled to fill one target batch.
5. The disposable worker constructs the target only once and separately
   records model initialization, warmup, and multiple steady-state batches.
   It reports steady input throughput and output ratio. Defaults are one
   warmup batch and three measured batches. Replay and measurement use the
   recipe's `skip_op_error`, so a few invalid rows are skipped exactly as in the
   formal run instead of aborting the job at preflight. Because one measured
   batch is repeated, a batch that returns nothing is not a usable measurement:
   a Mapper that returns no rows always fails preflight with its operator name
   (with `skip_op_error` the whole batch took the error path, without it the
   operator returned empty where it should have raised), while a
   Filter that keeps nothing only warns that its throughput is worst-case.
   Preflight no longer sets the `DATA_JUICER_GPU_PREFLIGHT_OP` marker, because
   operators that reacted to it with extra CUDA synchronizations could turn a
   normal model transfer into a multi-minute stall; custom operators must not
   depend on observing that variable.
6. A probe does not poll CUDA from a background thread during model
   initialization, avoiding `cudaMemGetInfo` contention with large
   `model.to(cuda)` transfers on the same CUDA context. The disposable worker
   lets the operator initialize CUDA as a formal actor would, then combines
   PyTorch's allocator peak with final persistent device usage (which also
   covers non-PyTorch runtimes such as Paddle). The measured value receives
   10% headroom and becomes `memory_fraction`. Ray's scheduling `num_gpus` is `max(memory_fraction,
   1 / max_gpu_workers_per_device)`; the default allows at most five
   auto-probed model actors per physical GPU.
7. Resource values, phased timing, throughput, output ratio, probe mode,
   replayed dependencies, and where the sample actually came from are saved in
   `{work_dir}/gpu_probe_results.json`. A resume
   reuses entries when the operator configuration, GPU model/capacity, and
   timing-batch settings, per-device worker cap, and sampling policy match, and
   re-probes otherwise. The source YAML is not overwritten.

For example, independent image taggers sharing a CPU resize can opt into the
parallel path without changing their Python classes:

```yaml
process:
  - bucket_resize_mapper:
      input_columns: [images]
      output_columns: [_bucket_img]
  - image_quality_mapper:
      input_columns: [images, _bucket_img]
      output_columns: [__dj__meta__.quality_score]
  - image_rotation_mapper:
      input_columns: [images, _bucket_img]
      output_columns: [__dj__meta__.rotation_*]
```

`None`/omitted metadata means unknown, not empty. Existing recipes therefore
retain ordered probing until their operators declare a complete contract.

An explicit `memory` or `num_gpus` wins over the measurement, except that a
`num_gpus` below the measured memory fraction is raised to it with a warning:
Ray packs actors by `num_gpus` alone, so a smaller request would let it place
more actors on a device than its memory allows. Preflight currently supports
ordinary Mapper/Filter operators that fit on one GPU.
GPU `Pipeline` operators, a `Pipeline` before a pending target, and multi-GPU
operators require explicit resources. Empty input, probe errors, OOM, and an
invalid zero peak fail before formal partition workers start.

### Checkpointing

```yaml
checkpoint:
  enabled: true
  strategy: every_n_ops  # every_n_ops (default), every_op, manual, disabled
  n_ops: 5               # Default: checkpoint every 5 operations
  op_names:              # For manual strategy - checkpoint after expensive ops
    - ray_document_deduplicator
    - extract_keyword_mapper
```

Choose `every_op`, `every_n_ops`, `manual`, or `disabled`. For `every_n_ops`, set `n_ops` to a positive integer. For `manual`, list operator names from your recipe in `op_names`.

When checkpointing is enabled, the initial run saves
`checkpoints/partitioning_info.json`. For every logical partition, this file
records:

- `start_row` (inclusive) and `end_row` (exclusive) in the ordered input;
- the partition row count;
- a stable hash of the complete partition contents;
- the partition hash algorithm used by the writer.

These values allow an explicit resume to recreate the original logical
partitions even when Ray produces a different physical block layout in the new
process. Complete partition hashes are sensitive to row order, independent of
Ray batch boundaries, and validated before any checkpoint is reused.

### Checkpoints and Temporary Files

Use `checkpoint.enabled` to turn checkpointing on or off and `checkpoint.strategy` to choose when to save. Checkpoints are saved as Parquet datasets under `checkpoint_dir`, which defaults to `<work_dir>/checkpoints`. Keep this directory to resume an interrupted job.

The executor cleans up its temporary working files when the run exits. Checkpoints are stored separately and remain available for resumption.

## Usage

### Running Jobs

```bash
# Auto partition mode
dj-process --config config.yaml --partition.mode auto

# Manual partition mode
dj-process --config config.yaml --partition.mode manual --partition.num_of_partitions 4

# Optional: start a new job with a custom job ID
dj-process --config config.yaml --job_id my_experiment_001
```

When checkpointing is enabled, a new `ray_partitioned` job prints a resume
token:

```text
Resume token: 20260805_115141_81270d. Rerun the original command with
--resume 20260805_115141_81270d to resume this job.
```

### Resuming Jobs

```bash
# Use the token printed by the initial run. Keep the input and recipe unchanged.
dj-process --config config.yaml --resume 20260805_115141_81270d

# A custom ID from the initial run can be used in the same way.
dj-process --config config.yaml --resume my_experiment_001
```

`--resume` is supported only by the `ray_partitioned` executor. It performs a
strict resume in the following order:

1. locate the original work and checkpoint directories;
2. verify that the current configuration matches the original run;
3. load the saved partition count, row boundaries, and content hashes;
4. recreate the original partitions with the saved row boundaries;
5. validate every complete partition hash;
6. load completed checkpoints and process only the unfinished work.

If metadata is missing, row boundaries are invalid, the input has changed, or
a content hash does not match, explicit resume stops with an error and leaves
the existing checkpoints unchanged.

Use `--job_id` to name a job. To resume it, add `--resume` with the original job ID to the original command.

If both arguments are supplied, their values must be identical:

```bash
dj-process --config config.yaml \
  --job_id my_experiment_001 \
  --resume my_experiment_001
```

### Checkpoint Strategies

```bash
# Every operation
dj-process --config config.yaml --checkpoint.strategy every_op

# Every N operations
dj-process --config config.yaml --checkpoint.strategy every_n_ops --checkpoint.n_ops 3

# Manual
dj-process --config config.yaml --checkpoint.strategy manual --checkpoint.op_names op1,op2
```

## Auto-Configuration

In auto mode, the optimizer:
1. Samples the dataset to detect modality (text, image, audio, video, multimodal)
2. Measures memory usage per sample
3. Analyzes pipeline complexity
4. Calculates partition size targeting the configured `target_size_mb`

Default partition sizes by modality:

| Modality | Default Size | Max Size | Memory Multiplier |
|----------|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| Text | 10000 | 50000 | 1.0x |
| Image | 2000 | 10000 | 5.0x |
| Audio | 1000 | 4000 | 8.0x |
| Video | 400 | 2000 | 20.0x |
| Multimodal | 1600 | 6000 | 10.0x |

- `op_start`, `op_complete`, `op_failed`
- `checkpoint_save`, `checkpoint_load`

## Performance Considerations

### Checkpoint vs Ray Optimization Trade-off

**Key insight: Checkpointing interferes with Ray's automatic optimization.**

Ray optimizes execution by fusing operations together and pipelining data. Each checkpoint forces materialization, which breaks the optimization window:

```
Without checkpoints:     op1 → op2 → op3 → op4 → op5
                         |___________________________|
                              Ray optimizes entire window

With every_op:           op1 | op2 | op3 | op4 | op5
                         materialize at each | (5 barriers)

With every_n_ops(5):     op1 → op2 → op3 → op4 → op5 |
                         |_____________________________|
                              Ray optimizes all 5 ops
```

### Checkpoint Cost Analysis

| Cost Type | Typical Value |
|-----------|---------------|
| Checkpoint write | ~2-5 seconds |
| Cheap op execution | ~1-2 seconds |
| Expensive op execution | minutes to hours |

**For cheap operations, checkpointing costs MORE than re-running on failure.**

Example pipeline analysis:
```
filter(1s) → mapper(2s) → deduplicator(300s) → filter(1s)

Strategy         | Overhead  | Protection Value
-----------------|-----------|------------------
every_op         | ~20s      | Save 1-304s on failure
after dedup only | ~5s       | Save 300s on failure
disabled         | 0s        | Re-run everything
```

### Strategy Recommendations

| Job Duration | Recommended Strategy | Rationale |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------|
| < 10 min | `disabled` | Re-running is cheap |
| 10-60 min | `every_n_ops` (n=5) | Balanced protection |
| > 60 min with expensive ops | `manual` | Checkpoint after expensive ops only |
| Unstable infrastructure | `every_n_ops` (n=2-3) | Accept overhead for reliability |

### Operation Categories

**Expensive operations (checkpoint after these):**
- `*_deduplicator` - Global state, expensive computation
- `*_embedding_*` - Model inference
- `*_model_*` - Model inference
- `*_vision_*` - Image/video processing
- `*_audio_*` - Audio processing

**Cheap operations (skip checkpointing):**
- `*_filter` - Simple filtering
- `clean_*` - Text cleaning
- `remove_*` - Field removal

### Storage Recommendations

- Event logs: fast storage (SSD)
- Checkpoints: large capacity storage

### Partition Sizing Trade-offs

- Smaller partitions: better fault tolerance, more scheduling overhead
- Larger partitions: less overhead, coarser recovery granularity

## Troubleshooting

**Job resumption fails:**
```bash
ls -la ./outputs/{work_dir}/{job_id}/job_summary.json
ls -la ./outputs/{work_dir}/{job_id}/checkpoints/
cat ./outputs/{work_dir}/{job_id}/checkpoints/partitioning_info.json
```

Use the resume token printed by the original run and rerun the same recipe with
`--resume`. Check the error log for configuration mismatch, missing partition
metadata, invalid row boundaries, or partition content hash mismatch. Explicit
resume does not delete checkpoints when validation fails.

**Check Ray status:**
```bash
ray status
```

**View logs:**
```bash
cat ./outputs/{work_dir}/{job_id}/events_*.jsonl
tail -f ./outputs/{work_dir}/{job_id}/logs/*.txt
```
