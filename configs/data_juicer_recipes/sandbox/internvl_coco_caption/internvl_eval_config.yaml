# This is one of the config file for reproducing the Sandbox experiments for InternVL COCO Caption task.
#
# This is the evaluation config for InternVLCOCOCaptionTrainExecutor hook.
# Similar to the one for training, you should clone the repo to your own <internvl_home> path and replace it with the
# real path.
# You can follow the doc [here](https://internvl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/installation.html) to install
# the InternVL or you can only need to clone and let the sandbox create and install the environment automatically.
# And you need to replace all "<internvl_home>" in the config files with your own real path to InternVL home on you machine.
