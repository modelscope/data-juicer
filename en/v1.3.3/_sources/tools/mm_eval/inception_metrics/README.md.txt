## Introduction of Metrics

### FVD
The Frechet Video Distance (FVD)<sup>[1](#reference)</sup> measures the distance of distribution of video features from real dataset and fake dataset, extracted by a video classifier. The video classifier is an I3D model, trained on Kinetics-400, containing 400 human action classes.

### KVD
The Kernel Video Distance (KVD) is the video version of Frechet Inception Distance (FID)<sup>[3](#reference)</sup>, which extract features from videos by an I3D model, trained on Kinetics-400, containing 400 human action classes.

### ISV
The Inception Score of Videos (ISV)<sup>[2](#reference)</sup> evaluates the generated videos based on their quality and diversity, with a preference for diversity. Utilizing a C3D video classification model trained on the UCF101 action recognition dataset, ISV assesses quality through the classification certainty of each video—specifically, by computing the sum of the negative entropy of individual predictions. Meanwhile, diversity is gauged by the entropy of the prediction averages.

### PRV
The Precision/Recall of Videos (PRV) is the video version of Precision/Recall (PR)<sup>[5](#reference)</sup>, which extract features from videos by an I3D model, trained on Kinetics-400, containing 400 human action classes.

### FID
The Frechet Inception Distance (FID)<sup>[3](#reference)</sup> shares similarities with FVD in its approach, evaluating videos by analyzing the features of individual frames derived from an image classification model trained on ImageNet.

### KID
The Kernel Inception Distance (KID)<sup>[4](#reference)</sup> is similar to FID and quantifies the dissimilarity between two sets of videos by computing the squared maximum mean discrepancy of the features of frames through multiple samplings. Unlike FID, KID utilizes an unbiased estimator with a third-degree kernel, aligning more consistently with human perception. The applied image classification model is same as the model FID applied.

### IS
The Inception Score (IS)<sup>[2](#reference)</sup> shares similarities with ISV in its approach, evaluating videos by analyzing the predictions of individual frames derived from an image classification model trained on ImageNet.

### PR
The Precision/Recall (PR)<sup>[5](#reference)</sup> estimates the distribution of features of frames in the feature space by demarcating a region within the distance to the k-nearest neighbor features. It then assesses the precision and recall of frame generation by determining whether samples fall within the distributions of the real and fake datasets. The features are extracted from the VGG image classification model<sup>[6](#reference)</sup> trained on ILSVRC-2012.
