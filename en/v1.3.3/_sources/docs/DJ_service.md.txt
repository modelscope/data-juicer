To further enhance the user experience of Data-Juicer, we have introduced a new service feature based on API (Service API), enabling users to integrate and utilize Data-Juicer's powerful operator pool in a more convenient way. With this service feature, users can quickly build data processing pipelines without needing to delve into the underlying implementation details of the framework, and seamlessly integrate with existing systems. Additionally, users can achieve environment isolation between different projects through this service. This document will provide a detailed explanation of how to launch and use this service feature, helping you get started quickly and fully leverage the potential of Data-Juicer.

# Start the Service
Run the following code:
```bash
uvicorn service:app
```

# API Calls
The API supports calling all functions and classes in Data-Juicer's `__init__.py` (including calling specific functions of a class). Functions are called via GET, while classes are called via POST.

## Protocol

### URL Path
For GET requests to call functions, the URL path corresponds to the function reference path in the Data-Juicer library. For example, `from data_juicer.config import init_configs` maps to the path `data_juicer/config/init_configs`. For POST requests to call a specific function of a class, the URL path is constructed by appending the function name to the class path in the Data-Juicer library. For instance, calling the `compute_stats_batched` function of the `TextLengthFilter` operator corresponds to the path `data_juicer/ops/filter/TextLengthFilter/compute_stats_batched`.

### Parameters
When making GET and POST calls, parameters are automatically converted into lists. Additionally, query parameters do not support dictionary transmission. Therefore, if the value of a parameter is a list or dictionary, we uniformly transmit it using `json.dumps` and prepend a special symbol `<json_dumps>` to distinguish it from regular strings.

### Special Cases
1. For the `cfg` parameter, we default to transmitting it using `json.dumps`, without needing to prepend the special symbol `<json_dumps>`.
2. For the `dataset` parameter, users can pass the path of the dataset on the server, and the server will load the dataset.
3. Users can set the `skip_return` parameter. When set to `True`, the result of the function call will not be returned, avoiding errors caused by network transmission issues.

## Function Calls
GET requests are used for function calls, with the URL path corresponding to the function reference path in the Data-Juicer library. Query parameters are used to pass the function arguments.

For example, the following Python code can be used to call Data-Juicer's `init_configs` function to retrieve all parameters of Data-Juicer:

```python
import requests
import json

json_prefix = '<json_dumps>'
url = 'http://localhost:8000/data_juicer/config/init_configs'
params = {"args": json_prefix + json.dumps(['--config', './configs/demo/process.yaml'])}
response = requests.get(url, params=params)
print(json.loads(response.text))
```

The corresponding curl command is as follows:

```bash
curl -G "http://localhost:8000/data_juicer/config/init_configs" \
     --data-urlencode "args=--config" \
     --data-urlencode "args=./configs/demo/process.yaml"
```

## Class Function Calls
POST requests are used for class function calls, with the URL path constructed by appending the function name to the class path in the Data-Juicer library. Query parameters are used to pass the function arguments, while JSON fields are used to pass the arguments required for the class constructor.

For example, the following Python code can be used to call Data-Juicer's `TextLengthFilter` operator:

```python
import requests
import json

json_prefix = '<json_dumps>'
url = 'http://localhost:8000/data_juicer/ops/filter/TextLengthFilter/compute_stats_batched'
params = {'samples': json_prefix + json.dumps({'text': ['12345', '123'], '__dj__stats__': [{}, {}]})}
init_json = {'min_len': 4, 'max_len': 10}
response = requests.post(url, params=params, json=init_json)
print(json.loads(response.text))
```

The corresponding curl command is as follows:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "http://localhost:8000/data_juicer/ops/filter/TextLengthFilter/compute_stats_batched?samples=%3Cjson_dumps%3E%7B%22text%22%3A%20%5B%2212345%22%2C%20%22123%22%5D%2C%20%22__dj__stats__%22%3A%20%5B%7B%7D%2C%20%7B%7D%5D%7D" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"min_len": 4, "max_len": 10}'
```

**Note**: If you need to call the `run` function of the `Executor` or `Analyzer` classes for data processing and data analysis, you must first call the `init_configs` or `get_init_configs` function to obtain the complete Data-Juicer parameters to construct these two classes. For more details, refer to the demonstration below.

# Demonstration
We have integrated [AgentScope](https://github.com/modelscope/agentscope) to enable users to invoke Data-Juicer operators for data cleaning through natural language. The operators are invoked via an API service. For the specific code, please refer to [here](../demos/api_service).
