# Partitioned Processing with Checkpointing

This document describes DataJuicer's fault-tolerant processing system with partitioning, checkpointing, and event logging.

## Overview

The `ray_partitioned` executor splits datasets into partitions and processes them with configurable checkpointing. Failed jobs can resume from the last checkpoint.

**Checkpointing strategies:**
- `every_n_ops` - checkpoint every N operations (default, balanced)
- `every_op` - checkpoint after every operation (max protection, impacts performance)
- `manual` - checkpoint only after specified operations (best for known expensive ops)
- `disabled` - no checkpointing (best performance)

```

## Configuration

### Partition Modes

**Auto mode** (recommended) - analyzes data and resources to determine optimal partitioning:

```yaml
executor_type: ray_partitioned

partition:
  mode: "auto"
  max_concurrent_partitions: "auto"  # Resource-aware driver concurrency
  target_size_mb: 256    # Target size in MB used for auto-mode planning
```

**Manual mode** - specify exact partition count:

```yaml
partition:
  mode: "manual"
  num_of_partitions: 8
  max_concurrent_partitions: "auto"
```

To choose a target number of samples per partition, set `size` instead of `num_of_partitions`. Choose one of these settings in manual mode. Data-Juicer rounds the partition count to the nearest whole number, with at least one partition. The last partition holds the remaining rows: for 12,000 rows and `size: 5000`, the two partitions contain 5,000 and 7,000 rows.

```yaml
partition:
  mode: "manual"
  size: 5000
```

In auto mode, start with `target_size_mb: 256` and adjust it to tune partition sizes. This is a planning target, so actual memory use and output file sizes can differ. You can also set `partition.size` as a sample-count fallback for automatic planning.

`max_concurrent_partitions: "auto"` is the default. It is resolved after
operator resource planning: GPU pipelines use the tightest CPU/GPU worker
capacity reported by the Ray cluster, while CPU-only pipelines use a
conservative outer-pipeline cap of 4. The actual concurrency is also bounded by
the partition count and any explicit global actor `num_proc` budget. Set a
positive integer to override the automatic limit.

### Checkpointing

```yaml
checkpoint:
  enabled: true
  strategy: every_n_ops  # every_n_ops (default), every_op, manual, disabled
  n_ops: 5               # Default: checkpoint every 5 operations
  op_names:              # For manual strategy - checkpoint after expensive ops
    - ray_document_deduplicator
    - extract_keyword_mapper
```

Choose `every_op`, `every_n_ops`, `manual`, or `disabled`. For `every_n_ops`, set `n_ops` to a positive integer. For `manual`, list operator names from your recipe in `op_names`.

When checkpointing is enabled, the initial run saves
`checkpoints/partitioning_info.json`. For every logical partition, this file
records:

- `start_row` (inclusive) and `end_row` (exclusive) in the ordered input;
- the partition row count;
- a stable hash of the complete partition contents;
- the partition hash algorithm used by the writer.

These values allow an explicit resume to recreate the original logical
partitions even when Ray produces a different physical block layout in the new
process. Complete partition hashes are sensitive to row order, independent of
Ray batch boundaries, and validated before any checkpoint is reused.

### Checkpoints and Temporary Files

Use `checkpoint.enabled` to turn checkpointing on or off and `checkpoint.strategy` to choose when to save. Checkpoints are saved as Parquet datasets under `checkpoint_dir`, which defaults to `<work_dir>/checkpoints`. Keep this directory to resume an interrupted job.

The executor cleans up its temporary working files when the run exits. Checkpoints are stored separately and remain available for resumption.

## Usage

### Running Jobs

```bash
# Auto partition mode
dj-process --config config.yaml --partition.mode auto

# Manual partition mode
dj-process --config config.yaml --partition.mode manual --partition.num_of_partitions 4

# Optional: start a new job with a custom job ID
dj-process --config config.yaml --job_id my_experiment_001
```

When checkpointing is enabled, a new `ray_partitioned` job prints a resume
token:

```text
Resume token: 20260805_115141_81270d. Rerun the original command with
--resume 20260805_115141_81270d to resume this job.
```

### Resuming Jobs

```bash
# Use the token printed by the initial run. Keep the input and recipe unchanged.
dj-process --config config.yaml --resume 20260805_115141_81270d

# A custom ID from the initial run can be used in the same way.
dj-process --config config.yaml --resume my_experiment_001
```

`--resume` is supported only by the `ray_partitioned` executor. It performs a
strict resume in the following order:

1. locate the original work and checkpoint directories;
2. verify that the current configuration matches the original run;
3. load the saved partition count, row boundaries, and content hashes;
4. recreate the original partitions with the saved row boundaries;
5. validate every complete partition hash;
6. load completed checkpoints and process only the unfinished work.

If metadata is missing, row boundaries are invalid, the input has changed, or
a content hash does not match, explicit resume stops with an error and leaves
the existing checkpoints unchanged.

Use `--job_id` to name a job. To resume it, add `--resume` with the original job ID to the original command.

If both arguments are supplied, their values must be identical:

```bash
dj-process --config config.yaml \
  --job_id my_experiment_001 \
  --resume my_experiment_001
```

### Checkpoint Strategies

```bash
# Every operation
dj-process --config config.yaml --checkpoint.strategy every_op

# Every N operations
dj-process --config config.yaml --checkpoint.strategy every_n_ops --checkpoint.n_ops 3

# Manual
dj-process --config config.yaml --checkpoint.strategy manual --checkpoint.op_names op1,op2
```

## Auto-Configuration

In auto mode, the optimizer:
1. Samples the dataset to detect modality (text, image, audio, video, multimodal)
2. Measures memory usage per sample
3. Analyzes pipeline complexity
4. Calculates partition size targeting the configured `target_size_mb`

Default partition sizes by modality:

| Modality | Default Size | Max Size | Memory Multiplier |
|----------|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| Text | 10000 | 50000 | 1.0x |
| Image | 2000 | 10000 | 5.0x |
| Audio | 1000 | 4000 | 8.0x |
| Video | 400 | 2000 | 20.0x |
| Multimodal | 1600 | 6000 | 10.0x |

## Job Management Utilities

### Monitor

```bash
# Show progress
python -m data_juicer.utils.job.monitor {job_id}

# Detailed view
python -m data_juicer.utils.job.monitor {job_id} --detailed

# Watch mode
python -m data_juicer.utils.job.monitor {job_id} --watch --interval 10
```

```python
from data_juicer.utils.job.monitor import show_job_progress

data = show_job_progress("job_id", detailed=True)
```

### Stopper

```bash
# Graceful stop
python -m data_juicer.utils.job.stopper {job_id}

# Force stop
python -m data_juicer.utils.job.stopper {job_id} --force

# List running jobs
python -m data_juicer.utils.job.stopper --list
```

```python
from data_juicer.utils.job.stopper import stop_job

stop_job("job_id", force=True, timeout=60)
```

### Common Utilities

```python
from data_juicer.utils.job.common import JobUtils, list_running_jobs

running_jobs = list_running_jobs()

job_utils = JobUtils("job_id")
summary = job_utils.load_job_summary()
events = job_utils.load_event_logs()
```

## Event Types

- `job_start`, `job_complete`, `job_failed`
- `partition_start`, `partition_complete`, `partition_failed`
- `op_start`, `op_complete`, `op_failed`
- `checkpoint_save`, `checkpoint_load`

## Performance Considerations

### Checkpoint vs Ray Optimization Trade-off

**Key insight: Checkpointing interferes with Ray's automatic optimization.**

Ray optimizes execution by fusing operations together and pipelining data. Each checkpoint forces materialization, which breaks the optimization window:

```
Without checkpoints:     op1 → op2 → op3 → op4 → op5
                         |___________________________|
                              Ray optimizes entire window

With every_op:           op1 | op2 | op3 | op4 | op5
                         materialize at each | (5 barriers)

With every_n_ops(5):     op1 → op2 → op3 → op4 → op5 |
                         |_____________________________|
                              Ray optimizes all 5 ops
```

### Checkpoint Cost Analysis

| Cost Type | Typical Value |
|-----------|---------------|
| Checkpoint write | ~2-5 seconds |
| Cheap op execution | ~1-2 seconds |
| Expensive op execution | minutes to hours |

**For cheap operations, checkpointing costs MORE than re-running on failure.**

Example pipeline analysis:
```
filter(1s) → mapper(2s) → deduplicator(300s) → filter(1s)

Strategy         | Overhead  | Protection Value
-----------------|-----------|------------------
every_op         | ~20s      | Save 1-304s on failure
after dedup only | ~5s       | Save 300s on failure
disabled         | 0s        | Re-run everything
```

### Strategy Recommendations

| Job Duration | Recommended Strategy | Rationale |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------|
| < 10 min | `disabled` | Re-running is cheap |
| 10-60 min | `every_n_ops` (n=5) | Balanced protection |
| > 60 min with expensive ops | `manual` | Checkpoint after expensive ops only |
| Unstable infrastructure | `every_n_ops` (n=2-3) | Accept overhead for reliability |

### Operation Categories

**Expensive operations (checkpoint after these):**
- `*_deduplicator` - Global state, expensive computation
- `*_embedding_*` - Model inference
- `*_model_*` - Model inference
- `*_vision_*` - Image/video processing
- `*_audio_*` - Audio processing

**Cheap operations (skip checkpointing):**
- `*_filter` - Simple filtering
- `clean_*` - Text cleaning
- `remove_*` - Field removal

### Storage Recommendations

- Event logs: fast storage (SSD)
- Checkpoints: large capacity storage

### Partition Sizing Trade-offs

- Smaller partitions: better fault tolerance, more scheduling overhead
- Larger partitions: less overhead, coarser recovery granularity

## Troubleshooting

**Job resumption fails:**
```bash
ls -la ./outputs/{work_dir}/{job_id}/job_summary.json
ls -la ./outputs/{work_dir}/{job_id}/checkpoints/
cat ./outputs/{work_dir}/{job_id}/checkpoints/partitioning_info.json
```

Use the resume token printed by the original run and rerun the same recipe with
`--resume`. Check the error log for configuration mismatch, missing partition
metadata, invalid row boundaries, or partition content hash mismatch. Explicit
resume does not delete checkpoints when validation fails.

**Check Ray status:**
```bash
ray status
```

**View logs:**
```bash
cat ./outputs/{work_dir}/{job_id}/events_*.jsonl
tail -f ./outputs/{work_dir}/{job_id}/logs/*.txt
```
