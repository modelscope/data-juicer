Data is the key to the unprecedented development of large multi-modal models such as SORA. How to obtain and process data efficiently and scientifically faces new challenges! DJ-SORA aims to create a series of large-scale, high-quality open-source multi-modal data sets to assist the open-source community in data understanding and model training.

DJ-SORA is based on Data-Juicer (including hundreds of dedicated video, image, audio, text and other multi-modal data processing [operators](Operators.md) and tools) to form a series of systematic and reusable Multimodal "data recipes" for analyzing, cleaning, and generating large-scale, high-quality multimodal data.

This project is being actively updated and maintained. We eagerly invite you to participate and jointly create a more open and higher-quality multi-modal data ecosystem to unleash the unlimited potential of large models!

## Motivation
- SORA only briefly mentions using DALLE-3 to generate captions and can handle varying durations, resolutions and aspect ratios.
- High-quality large-scale fine-grained data helps to densify data points, aiding models to better learn the conditional mapping of "text -> spacetime token", and solve a series of existing challenges in text-to-video models:
  - Smoothness of visual flow, with some generated videos exhibiting dropped frames and static states.
  - Text comprehension and fine-grained detail, where the produced results have a low match with the given prompts.
  - Generated content showing distortions and violations of physical laws, especially when entities are in motion.
  - Short video content, mostly around ~10 seconds, with little to no significant changes in scenes or backdrops.
