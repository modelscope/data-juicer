- **Systematic & Reusable**:
  Empowering users with a systematic library of 100+ core [OPs](docs/Operators.md), and 50+ reusable config recipes and 
  dedicated toolkits, designed to
  function independently of specific multimodal LLM datasets and processing pipelines. Supporting data analysis, cleaning, and synthesis in pre-training, post-tuning, en, zh, and more scenarios.

- **User-Friendly & Extensible**: 
  Designed for simplicity and flexibility, with easy-start [guides](docs/tutorial/QuickStart.md), and [DJ-Cookbook](docs/tutorial/DJ-Cookbook.md) containing fruitful demo usages. Feel free to [implement your own OPs](docs/DeveloperGuide.md#build-your-own-ops) for customizable data processing.

- **Efficient & Robust**: Providing performance-optimized [parallel data processing](docs/Distributed.md) (Aliyun-PAI\Ray\CUDA\OP Fusion),
  faster with less resource usage, verified in large-scale production environments.


- **Effect-Proven & Sandbox**: Supporting data-model co-development, enabling rapid iteration
  through the [sandbox laboratory](docs/Sandbox.md), and providing features such as feedback loops and visualization, so that you can better understand and improve your data and models. Many effect-proven datasets and models have been derived from DJ, in scenarios such as pre-training, text-to-video and image-to-text generation.
