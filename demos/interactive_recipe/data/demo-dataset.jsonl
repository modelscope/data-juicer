{"id": "personahub_dgoarkb4hk2xjno6q51d3z26", "messages": [{"content": "A school principal is planning to optimize the allocation of resources among various educational programs to improve overall student performance. The principal works closely with teachers, parents, and local government authorities to ensure the school is utilizing its budget effectively. The budget is split into three categories: academic programs, extracurricular activities, and infrastructure improvements. The principal aims to maximize the weighted average performance score, \\( P \\), which is influenced by the spending in each category.\n\nThe performance score \\( P \\) is modeled by the function:\n\n\\[ P = 0.4\\sqrt{A} + 0.3\\sqrt{E} + 0.3\\sqrt{I} \\]\n\nwhere \\( A \\), \\( E \\), and \\( I \\) represent the amounts spent on academic programs, extracurricular activities, and infrastructure improvements respectively, and \\( A + E + I = B \\), with \\( B \\) being the total budget.\n\n1. Given a total budget \\( B = 900,000 \\) units, determine the optimal allocation of \\( A \\), \\( E \\), and \\( I \\) to maximize the performance score \\( P \\).\n\n2. Suppose the local government proposes an incentive: if the school spends at least 50% of its total budget on academic programs, the government will provide an additional 10% of the total budget as a bonus.
