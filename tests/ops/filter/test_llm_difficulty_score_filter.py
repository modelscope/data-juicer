Plants use sunlight to convert this carbon dioxide into glucose and other organic compounds, storing carbon in their biomass. When plants die or are consumed, the carbon is released back into the environment through decomposition or respiration, completing the cycle."

Gödel's incompleteness theorems state that in any sufficiently powerful formal system, there will always be true statements that cannot be proven within the system. This has profound implications for the limits of mathematical reasoning and the nature of truth. To address this, one must understand formal logic, axiomatic systems, and the philosophical debates surrounding mathematical foundations.",
            "answer": "Gödel's incompleteness theorems imply that no formal system capable of expressing arithmetic can be both consistent and complete. There will always exist true statements that cannot be derived from the axioms of the system. This challenges the notion of a single, all-encompassing formal system for mathematics and highlights the inherent limitations of logical reasoning. Philosophically, it raises questions about whether mathematical truth is independent of human construction or if it is inherently incomplete."
