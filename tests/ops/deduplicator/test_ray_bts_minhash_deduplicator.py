                'in the hallways, locker rooms, cafeterias, and cutting '

                'Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and '

                'positive, together with 206 people close to them. The '
                'outbreak has killed Agustín Rodríguez Martínez, aged 64, an '
                'employee with two decades of experience originally from El '
                'Salvador, and Craig Allen Franken, 61, who worked for '
                'Smithfield his entire adult life.\n\nThe company knew of its '
                'first infection on March 24 or earlier. The virus spread '
                'exponentially for several weeks. Ahead of Easter Sunday and '
                'Monday (April 12-13), Smithfield promised to “completely '
                'shutter” to sanitize and put up cardboard and plastic sheet '
                'dividers. This would not end transmission, as potentially '

                'AFL-CIO alleges the plant ran 60 percent production. On '
                'Easter, with 238 known infections, Smithfield finally '
                'agreed to shut down indefinitely after a request from the '
                'mayor and the governor. Yet the company insisted on waiting '
                'three more days to actually halt production.\n\nSmithfield '
                'denied contributing to the outbreak, saying it took a “very '
                'proactive approach.” Relying on racism, the company blamed '
                'workers for getting themselves sick. A spokesperson said '
                'the outbreak was so severe because of the plant’s “large '
                'immigrant population,” claming “Living circumstances in '
                'certain cultures are different than they are with your '
                'traditional American family.” They slandered the workers as '
                'dirty, ignorant, and untrustworthy with help from governor '
                'Kristi Noem, who claimed, “99 percent of what’s going on '
                'today wasn’t happening inside the facility. It was more at '
                'home, where these employees were going home and spreading '
                'some of the virus” by living too close together.\n\nOne '
                'sick worker, Michael Bul Gayo Gatluak, 22 and originally '
                'from South Sudan, says, “With how we work on the line, '
                'I would say I got sick because of them not taking safety '
                'measures.” His job is “really, really close” to other '
                'workers chopping fresh-killed pigs. “The job is so heavy. '
                'You have to breathe so hard.”\n\nIn early March, '
                'union officials requested masks, overcoats, entrance '
                'checking for fevers, and less crowding in 500-capacity '
                'cafeterias. But Smithfield waited on most safety measures '
                'until early April. Only April 6 did they start checking for '
                'fevers. Instead of protective masks, they gave out beard '
                'nets.\n\nSmithfield concealed infections with a policy of '
                'informing only employees whose work stations were in the '
                'same area as a person who tested positive. The fact that '
                'workers are required to move around was willfully ignored. '
                'One worker who tested positive said, “I clearly would have '
                'gotten it at the factory. This week I have worked on three '
                'different floors. I’ve eaten in two different cafeterias … '
                'I’ve been walking through the whole place.” Employees from '
                'the eighth floor of the plant were quarantined, '
                'but everyone else was told to keep working.\n\nWhat Is '
                'Really Going On?\n\nAverage plant wages are around $16 an '
                'hour. Smithfield never raised them. Instead, they offered '
                '$500 to employees who could go all of April without an '
                'unapproved day off. The company says their “Responsibility '
                'Bonuses” show their “immense gratefulness” to employees '
                '“for their selfless sacrifices.”\n\nMeanwhile, the local '
                'Argus Leader wrote union members wanted essential-worker '
                'hazard pay, which “would be considered hourly compensation '
                'about 1.5 or two times their normal pay.” One worker said, '
                '“I feel like they’re bribing us with [the bonus] to come to '
                'work sick. That’s how you know they don’t care.”\n\nBoth '
                'Sioux Falls workers killed by Covid-19 were in their '
                'sixties. It is unconscionable that they were still working. '
                'All meatpackers over 50 should be on paid leave. Agustín '
                'Rodríguez, 64, had a rough job sawing the legs off dead '
                'pigs. He mopped floors with a fever shortly before he was '
                'hospitalized.\n\nWhen CEO Kenneth Sullivan closed the '
                'plant, he claimed, “We have continued to run our facilities '
                'for one reason: to sustain our nation’s food supply.” This '
                'is an effort to sweep Smithfield’s abuses under the rug, '
                'as if the company were operating for public benefit. This '
                'patriotic propaganda that all Americans are in it together '
                'is like a drug to keep workers from getting '
                'organized.\n\nThe major union in the industry, including at '
                'Smithfield, is the United Food and Commercial Workers union '
                '(UFCW). What union leaders have done is ultimately '
                'troubling.\n\nCan Workers Fight?\n\nLocal AFL-CIO president '
                'Kooper Caraway has publicly said management delayed safety '
                'action as long as possible for profit. But while some '
                'workers were demanding a two-week shutdown, Caraway told '
                'the Argus Leader that was unrealistic because the '
                'government considers the plant essential. He suggested the '
                'union would be happy with minimal safety measures: “Even if '
                '10 people get exposed in a day rather than 11. If you can '
                'implement a program where even one or two less people get '
                'exposed during a shift, that’s one or two less people.” Of '
                'course reducing infections is good, but suggesting workers '
                'would be satisfied if the company allowed 90% of the '
                'contagion to continue is horrifying.\n\nThe response of '
                'UFCW leadership was worse. As the disease was exploding, '
                'they told the Argus Leader, “We applaud [Smithfield’s] '
                'decision to temporarily close the plant [over Easter '
                'weekend] to push for an even safer work environment.” What '
                'does “even safer” mean in this context?\n\nThe union '
                'bureaucracy has taken weak action elsewhere. In '
                'Pennsylvania, the UFCW negotiated $2 hazard pay for two '
                'months with Cargill Meat — the same pandemic premium Amazon '
                'gave workers without a union. In Nebraska, the UFCW '
                'negotiated $4 hazard pay for one month with meat giant '
                'JBS.\n\nThe union has said nothing about forcing companies '
                'to send older workers home with pay, even though a '
                '70-year-old shop steward and a 78-year-old grandfather '
                'working at JBS plants were killed by Covid-19. Smithfield '
                'workers were promised only two weeks of shutdown pay. For '
                'many, this compensation is half their normal paycheck '
                'because they routinely put in 66 hour weeks — overtime that '
                'costs exhaustion and chronic pain.\n\nUnion officials '
                'endeavor to cooperate with the meat companies. An Iowa UFCW '
                'president actually suggested it might be impossible for '
                'plants to move workers a full six feet apart and told the '
                'Des Moines Register, “We can’t stop the plants. If we stop '
                'the plants from running, we stop feeding the country. We '
                'want to do everything we can to make sure the employees are '
                'safe to keep the plant running.”\n\nEvery part of this '
                'explanation directly overlaps with what the Smithfield CEO '
                'said. Unfortunately, it amounts to accepting the company’s '
                'excuses.\n\nThey claim that workers who do hard physical '
                'labor, waking up at 4 a.m. and often working six days a '
                'week for years, would be guilty of taking food away from '
                'the people and hurting America if they dared to fight for '
                'their human needs. But nothing is said about the company '
                'raking in profits and even murdering workers to increase '
                'them.\n\nSmithfield’s parent company W.H. Group, '
                'which slaughters around 30 million pigs per year in plants '
                'in both the United States and China, saw its profits '
                'skyrocket by about one third in 2019 to $1.38 billion. It '
                'is disturbing that UFCW officials do not bring up these '
                'soaring profits in their response to the outbreaks. Reuters '
                'published a report on the corporation’s financial success '
                'in late March. The head of W.H. Group had touted to the '
                'media that it got through the pandemic in China with very '
                'limited impact on production.\n\nIt is true that many '
                'Smithfield workers are reasonably afraid for their jobs and '
                'want to keep working. A 25-year-old employee explained, '
                '“I have a lot of bills. My baby’s coming soon — I have to '
                'work.” At the same time, he was afraid of infecting his '
                'pregnant wife. His spouse, a former employee, '
                'said bitterly, “Smithfield— they don’t care about '
                'employees. They only care about their money.”\n\nWorkers '
                'are pressured in these two painful directions. Nonetheless, '
                'work can mean solidarity. Before Smithfield even checked '
                'temperatures, there was a “sick-out” strike without union '
                'support by 800 to 1,000 workers at a JBS meat factory in '
                'Colorado. Hundreds of workers also called in sick days at a '
                'Nebraska JBS plant.\n\nTrade union leaders won’t even '
                'whisper the word “strike” when thousands of workers are '
                'thinking about it. They are limiting themselves to polite '
                'requests. We need a workers’ movement that asks who '
                'controls the factory, that threatens to disrupt the bosses’ '
                'profits, and that allows workers to use their immense power '
                '— this could change the meat industry and the world. '

                'Rodríguez, 64, had a rough job sawing the legs off dead '
                'pigs. He mopped floors with a fever shortly before he was '
                'hospitalized.\n\nWhen CEO Kenneth Sullivan closed the '
                'plant, he claimed, “We have continued to run our facilities '
                'for one reason: to sustain our nation’s food supply.” This '
                'is an effort to sweep Smithfield’s abuses under the rug, '
                'as if the company were operating for public benefit. This '
                'patriotic propaganda that all Americans are in it together '
                'is like a drug to keep workers from getting '
                'organized.\n\nThe major union in the industry, including at '
                'Smithfield, is the United Food and Commercial Workers union '
                '(UFCW). What union leaders have done is ultimately '
                'troubling.\n\nCan Workers Fight?\n\nLocal AFL-CIO president '
                'Kooper Caraway has publicly said management delayed safety '
                'action as long as possible for profit. But while some '
                'workers were demanding a two-week shutdown, Caraway told '
                'the Argus Leader that was unrealistic because the '
                'government considers the plant essential. He suggested the '
                'union would be happy with minimal safety measures: “Even if '
                '10 people get exposed in a day rather than 11. If you can '
                'implement a program where even one or two less people get '
                'exposed during a shift, that’s one or two less people.” Of '
                'course reducing infections is good, but suggesting workers '
                'would be satisfied if the company allowed 90% of the '
                'contagion to continue is horrifying.\n\nThe response of '
                'UFCW leadership was worse. As the disease was exploding, '
                'they told the Argus Leader, “We applaud [Smithfield’s] '
                'decision to temporarily close the plant [over Easter '
                'weekend] to push for an even safer work environment.” What '
                'does “even safer” mean in this context?\n\nThe union '
                'bureaucracy has taken weak action elsewhere. In '
                'Pennsylvania, the UFCW negotiated $2 hazard pay for two '
                'months with Cargill Meat — the same pandemic premium Amazon '
                'gave workers without a union. In Nebraska, the UFCW '
                'negotiated $4 hazard pay for one month with meat giant '
                'JBS.\n\nThe union has said nothing about forcing companies '
                'to send older workers home with pay, even though a '
                '70-year-old shop steward and a 78-year-old grandfather '
                'working at JBS plants were killed by Covid-19. Smithfield '
                'workers were promised only two weeks of shutdown pay. For '
                'many, this compensation is half their normal paycheck '
                'because they routinely put in 66 hour weeks — overtime that '
                'costs exhaustion and chronic pain.\n\nUnion officials '
                'endeavor to cooperate with the meat companies. An Iowa UFCW '
                'president actually suggested it might be impossible for '
                'plants to move workers a full six feet apart and told the '
                'Des Moines Register, “We can’t stop the plants. If we stop '
                'the plants from running, we stop feeding the country. We '
                'want to do everything we can to make sure the employees are '
                'safe to keep the plant running.”\n\nEvery part of this '
                'explanation directly overlaps with what the Smithfield CEO '
                'said. Unfortunately, it amounts to accepting the company’s '
                'excuses.\n\nThey claim that workers who do hard physical '
                'labor, waking up at 4 a.m. and often working six days a '
                'week for years, would be guilty of taking food away from '
                'the people and hurting America if they dared to fight for '
                'their human needs. But nothing is said about the company '
                'raking in profits and even murdering workers to increase '
                'them.\n\nSmithfield’s parent company W.H. Group, '
                'which slaughters around 30 million pigs per year in plants '
                'in both the United States and China, saw its profits '
                'skyrocket by about one third in 2019 to $1.38 billion. It '
                'is disturbing that UFCW officials do not bring up these '
                'soaring profits in their response to the outbreaks. Reuters '
                'published a report on the corporation’s financial success '
                'in late March. The head of W.H. Group had touted to the '
                'media that it got through the pandemic in China with very '
                'limited impact on production.\n\nIt is true that many '
                'Smithfield workers are reasonably afraid for their jobs and '
                'want to keep working. A 25-year-old employee explained, '
                '“I have a lot of bills. My baby’s coming soon — I have to '
                'work.” At the same time, he was afraid of infecting his '
                'pregnant wife. His spouse, a former employee, '
                'said bitterly, “Smithfield— they don’t care about '
                'employees. They only care about their money.”\n\nWorkers '
                'are pressured in these two painful directions. Nonetheless, '
                'work can mean solidarity. Before Smithfield even checked '
                'temperatures, there was a “sick-out” strike without union '
                'support by 800 to 1,000 workers at a JBS meat factory in '
                'Colorado. Hundreds of workers also called in sick days at a '
                'Nebraska JBS plant.\n\nTrade union leaders won’t even '
                'whisper the word “strike” when thousands of workers are '
                'thinking about it. They are limiting themselves to polite '
                'requests. We need a workers’ movement that asks who '
                'controls the factory, that threatens to disrupt the bosses’ '
                'profits, and that allows workers to use their immense power '
                '— this could change the meat industry and the world. '

                'home, where these employees were going home and spreading '
                'some of the virus” by living too close together.\n\nOne '
                'sick worker, Michael Bul Gayo Gatluak, 22 and originally '
                'from South Sudan, says, “With how we work on the line, '

                'checking for fevers, and less crowding in 500-capacity '
                'cafeterias. But Smithfield waited on most safety measures '
                'until early April. Only April 6 did they start checking for '
                'fevers. Instead of protective masks, they gave out beard '
                'nets.\n\nSmithfield concealed infections with a policy of '
                'informing only employees whose work stations were in the '
                'same area as a person who tested positive. The fact that '
                'workers are required to move around was willfully ignored. '
                'One worker who tested positive said, “I clearly would have '
                'gotten it at the factory. This week I have worked on three '
                'different floors. I’ve eaten in two different cafeterias … '
                'I’ve been walking through the whole place.” Employees from '
                'the eighth floor of the plant were quarantined, '
                'but everyone else was told to keep working.\n\nWhat Is '
                'Really Going On?\n\nAverage plant wages are around $16 an '
                'hour. Smithfield never raised them. Instead, they offered '
                '$500 to employees who could go all of April without an '
                'unapproved day off. The company says their “Responsibility '
                'Bonuses” show their “immense gratefulness” to employees '
                '“for their selfless sacrifices.”\n\nMeanwhile, the local '
                'Argus Leader wrote union members wanted essential-worker '
                'hazard pay, which “would be considered hourly compensation '
                'about 1.5 or two times their normal pay.” One worker said, '
                '“I feel like they’re bribing us with [the bonus] to come to '
                'work sick. That’s how you know they don’t care.”\n\nBoth '
                'Sioux Falls workers killed by Covid-19 were in their '
                'sixties. It is unconscionable that they were still working. '
                'All meatpackers over 50 should be on paid leave. Agustín '
                'Rodríguez, 64, had a rough job sawing the legs off dead '
                'pigs. He mopped floors with a fever shortly before he was '
                'hospitalized.\n\nWhen CEO Kenneth Sullivan closed the '
                'plant, he claimed, “We have continued to run our facilities '
                'for one reason: to sustain our nation’s food supply.” This '
                'is an effort to sweep Smithfield’s abuses under the rug, '
                'as if the company were operating for public benefit. This '
                'patriotic propaganda that all Americans are in it together '
                'is like a drug to keep workers from getting '
                'organized.\n\nThe major union in the industry, including at '
                'Smithfield, is the United Food and Commercial Workers union '
                '(UFCW). What union leaders have done is ultimately '
                'troubling.\n\nCan Workers Fight?\n\nLocal AFL-CIO president '
                'Kooper Caraway has publicly said management delayed safety '
                'action as long as possible for profit. But while some '
                'workers were demanding a two-week shutdown, Caraway told '
                'the Argus Leader that was unrealistic because the '
                'government considers the plant essential. He suggested the '
                'union would be happy with minimal safety measures: “Even if '
                '10 people get exposed in a day rather than 11. If you can '
                'implement a program where even one or two less people get '
                'exposed during a shift, that’s one or two less people.” Of '
                'course reducing infections is good, but suggesting workers '
                'would be satisfied if the company allowed 90% of the '
                'contagion to continue is horrifying.\n\nThe response of '
                'UFCW leadership was worse. As the disease was exploding, '
                'they told the Argus Leader, “We applaud [Smithfield’s] '
                'decision to temporarily close the plant [over Easter '
                'weekend] to push for an even safer work environment.” What '
                'does “even safer” mean in this context?\n\nThe union '
                'bureaucracy has taken weak action elsewhere. In '
                'Pennsylvania, the UFCW negotiated $2 hazard pay for two '
                'months with Cargill Meat — the same pandemic premium Amazon '
                'gave workers without a union. In Nebraska, the UFCW '
                'negotiated $4 hazard pay for one month with meat giant '
                'JBS.\n\nThe union has said nothing about forcing companies '
                'to send older workers home with pay, even though a '
                '70-year-old shop steward and a 78-year-old grandfather '
                'working at JBS plants were killed by Covid-19. Smithfield '
                'workers were promised only two weeks of shutdown pay. For '
                'many, this compensation is half their normal paycheck '
                'because they routinely put in 66 hour weeks — overtime that '
                'costs exhaustion and chronic pain.\n\nUnion officials '
                'endeavor to cooperate with the meat companies. An Iowa UFCW '
                'president actually suggested it might be impossible for '
                'plants to move workers a full six feet apart and told the '
                'Des Moines Register, “We can’t stop the plants. If we stop '
                'the plants from running, we stop feeding the country. We '
                'want to do everything we can to make sure the employees are '
                'safe to keep the plant running.”\n\nEvery part of this '
                'explanation directly overlaps with what the Smithfield CEO '
                'said. Unfortunately, it amounts to accepting the company’s '
                'excuses.\n\nThey claim that workers who do hard physical '
                'labor, waking up at 4 a.m. and often working six days a '
                'week for years, would be guilty of taking food away from '
                'the people and hurting America if they dared to fight for '
                'their human needs. But nothing is said about the company '
                'raking in profits and even murdering workers to increase '
                'them.\n\nSmithfield’s parent company W.H. Group, '
                'which slaughters around 30 million pigs per year in plants '
                'in both the United States and China, saw its profits '
                'skyrocket by about one third in 2019 to $1.38 billion. It '
                'is disturbing that UFCW officials do not bring up these '
                'soaring profits in their response to the outbreaks. Reuters '
                'published a report on the corporation’s financial success '
                'in late March. The head of W.H. Group had touted to the '
                'media that it got through the pandemic in China with very '
                'limited impact on production.\n\nIt is true that many '
                'Smithfield workers are reasonably afraid for their jobs and '
                'want to keep working. A 25-year-old employee explained, '
                '“I have a lot of bills. My baby’s coming soon — I have to '
                'work.” At the same time, he was afraid of infecting his '
                'pregnant wife. His spouse, a former employee, '
                'said bitterly, “Smithfield— they don’t care about '
                'employees. They only care about their money.”\n\nWorkers '
                'are pressured in these two painful directions. Nonetheless, '
                'work can mean solidarity. Before Smithfield even checked '
                'temperatures, there was a “sick-out” strike without union '
                'support by 800 to 1,000 workers at a JBS meat factory in '
                'Colorado. Hundreds of workers also called in sick days at a '
                'Nebraska JBS plant.\n\nTrade union leaders won’t even '
                'whisper the word “strike” when thousands of workers are '
                'thinking about it. They are limiting themselves to polite '
                'requests. We need a workers’ movement that asks who '
                'controls the factory, that threatens to disrupt the bosses’ '
                'profits, and that allows workers to use their immense power '
                '— this could change the meat industry and the world. '
